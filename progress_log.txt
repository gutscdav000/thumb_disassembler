32 bit instructions decoded:



bugs:

(add) - when rdn and rm are less than r8 the add instruction get's 
	32-bit encoded. for example:
	add r0, r3  <-- gets 32-bit encoded
	add r5, r7  <-- gets 32-bit encoded
	add r0, r1  <-- gets 32-bit encoded
	add r0, r12 <-- gets 16-bit encoded (correctly)
	add r3, r15 <-- gets 16-bit encoded (correctly)

(str rt [rn, imm8]) - some instructions being 32-bit encoded. and 
                     16-bit encoded istructions are being dumped to the hex file
      		     with incorrect imm8 bit values.

(str rt [rn, #imm5]) - some instructions are being 32-bit encoded. and 16-bit encoded instructions 
		       do not have the correct imm5 values.
